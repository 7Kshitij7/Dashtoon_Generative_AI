# Dashtoon_Generative_AI
Installing dependencies-
1. TensorFlow (This library is a machine learning library for developing and deploying deep learning models)
 *Installation*: TensorFlow can be installed using pip: 'pip install tensorflow'
2. matplotlib (This library provides a MATLAB-like plotting library for creating 2D plots and charts)
	*Installation*: Matplotlib can be installed using pip: 'pip install matplotlib'
3. NUMPY (scientific computing in Python, providing efficient numerical operations on arrays)
	*Installation*: Numpy can be installed using pip: 'pip install Numpy'
4. PIL.Image (provides functions for manipulating and generating images)
	*Installation*: PIL.Image can be installed using pip: 'pip install Pillow'

Setting up and running notebook-
1. For running the notebook, you'll require a dataset. I have shared which can be accessed by the Google Drive link below-
" https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rn7x8j2fdxQxPzKqBEOFWBg-lz9xpPLc?usp=sharing "

2. Run this notebook on a GPU-supported runtime since the NST task is very computationally expensive.

3. Now, run all of the cells in the notebooks which will run one by one, and see the style-transfer-goodness.
